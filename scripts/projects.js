    body: '<p>This was one of the first projects I worked on when I took the 201 course at Code Fellows. It was a website that had a home page with some lists and paragraphs that described me, for example my I made an ordered list of my top ten favorite destinations and I had a paragraph descrining my hobbies and what I like to do outside of school. There was also a guessing game and it had seven questions in total and would return a message with the users\'s name and how many questions they got correct out of the seven they were prompted to answer. The first five were yes or no answers and two questions were open ended questions and it provided multiple tries to get the answer correct.</p>'

    body: '<p>About halfway through the 201 course, we started working on a project called the cookie stand project. It was a website for a cookie store bakery in Seattle that made salmon cookies. The business had multiple locations and we had to display a table that showed the average cookie per hour, the average cutsomer per hour, the average cookie sale per customer, and the daily total for each store. There was also a home page with pictures of salmon and cookies and some other things that relate to eating and making salmon cookies.</p>'

    body: '<p>The bus-mall had the same exact concept as the Sky Mall Magazines but the one major difference was that this was on a website and they were implemented on busses. It was a website that displayed three images of the products they were selling and the user would click on their favorite product. It would then display another three random products that were different from the last set and the user would do the same thing until they hit 25 clicks. After 25 clicks, it would then display a bar graph of all the images and how many times you clicked on each one.</p>'
